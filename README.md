# QB VSCode Theme
A theme inspired by the Quantum Black brand and its OSS products (e.g. [kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html))

Install with a single click through the [VS Code Extension market place](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pascalwhoop.qb-theme).

**Disclaimer:**
Note that I make no claims to the brand name of QB nor to the accuracy of the colors
being exactly matching the official branding. I just wanted to make a nice theme and
share it with my colleagues ðŸ˜Š

I will leave it here until someone complains. I hope that doesn't happen ðŸ¤ž
